## About Me

Hi there! I'm Adrian and I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for AI. 
I'm always on the lookout for the latest advancements in the field, and I 
enjoy experimenting with new technologies.

In addition to my passion for AI, I have a background in data analysis, machine
learning, embedded systems, and web app development. I'm currently pursuing a 
Ph. D, where I'm gaining expertise in radar techniques, data processing and 
software life-cycle. I'm excited to use my skills and knowledge to tackle real-world 
challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.
