## About Me

Hi there! I'm Adrian Llanes, and I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for AI. 
I'm always on the lookout for the latest advancements in the field, and I 
enjoy experimenting with new technologies and building projects that showcase 
the power of AI.

In addition to my passion for AI, I have a background in data analysis, 
embedded systems, and web app development. I'm currently pursuing a Ph. D, 
where I'm gaining expertise in radar techniques and simulation. I'm excited to 
use my skills and knowledge to tackle real-world challenges and push the 
boundaries of what's possible with technology.
